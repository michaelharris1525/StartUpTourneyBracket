Have you ever wanted to see who is the best at something in your friend group? Whether it be a beta male game like playing chess or playing a full on 1 v 1 tournament playing smash brothers or basketball or something of the sort. And you wanted a cool way to be able to do it at the spot. Wouldnâ€™t it be cool to have some sort of website automatically do that for you while giving the participants options to bet on which of the players would win beforehand and keep track of the scores of each games per participant. That would be epic!
