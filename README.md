 Have you ever wanted to see who is the best at something in your friend group? 
        Whether it be a beta male game like playing chess or playing a full on 1 v 1 tournament 
        playing smash brothers or basketball or something of the sort. And you wanted a cool way 
        to be able to do it at the spot. Wouldn’t it be cool to have some sort of website 
        automatically do that for you while giving the participants options to bet on which 
        of the players would win beforehand and keep track of the scores of each games per 
        participant. That would be epic!

    My name is Michael Harris and I accidentally deleted the orignal respository for when we 1st branded our 
        idea for the first 100 point assignment we had. This is a recreation of it, as well as the full website 
        i will be changing throughout the semester. That is why I am missing a ton of other stuff in this README.md, that'll I'll have to go back and change and rewrite everything. With an image of the tourney bracket I want it to look like. 

(REQUIRED STARTUP HTML)
I modified the play.html creating tables of (8 player) players, their scores, and organized it in a way that reveals if they are in the semi's or finals or not. It isn't completed yet but it is a start. Also got the link on my about page. I changed the login to include a password. I changed the idea of a betting system to a websocket of a live chat while the tournament is going. I also changed how the scoring system will work that'll list the losers from the beginning to the end. SO if you got 2nd at the tournament you'll be listed last. 

I'm just learning a bit of the HTML, I learned a bit about classes and div and how to properly set up selectors and options for my players and score board. HTML is much difficult but easier to use at the same time for me. But its refreshing to use a lot of sources on the web to understand better how to create the brackets. 

(REQUIRED STARTUP CSS)
4 new css files for "play, scores, styles, and about".

Modified HTML file for play in order for it to contain the players. Used flex to center some of my content around. Add an image to the background of the main and about page. I may modify the page as time goes by, because I'm still unsatisfied with it. Used footers, main, nav, and edited everything i could onto the page. Will most definitely be fixing more and more of it throughout the semester. Added an actual table to both play and the scores page, and added more bars for the players.
