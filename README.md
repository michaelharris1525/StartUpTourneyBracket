 Have you ever wanted to see who is the best at something in your friend group? 
        Whether it be a beta male game like playing chess or playing a full on 1 v 1 tournament 
        playing smash brothers or basketball or something of the sort. And you wanted a cool way 
        to be able to do it at the spot. Wouldnâ€™t it be cool to have some sort of website 
        automatically do that for you while giving the participants options to bet on which 
        of the players would win beforehand and keep track of the scores of each games per 
        participant. That would be epic!

    My name is Michael Harris and I accidentally deleted the orignal respository for when we 1st branded our 
        idea for the first 100 point assignment we had. This is a recreation of it, as well as the full website 
        i will be changing throughout the semester. That is why I am missing a ton of other stuff in this README.md, that'll I'll have to go back and change and rewrite everything. With an image of the tourney bracket I want it to look like.
