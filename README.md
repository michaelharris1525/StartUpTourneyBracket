## Have you ever wanted to see who is the best at something in your friend group? Whether it be a beta male game like playing chess or playing a full on 1 v 1 tournament playing smash brothers or basketball or something of the sort. And you wanted a cool way to be able to do it at the spot. Wouldn’t it be cool to have some sort of **website** to automatically do that for you while giving the participants options to **vote** on which of the players would win beforehand and **keep track** of the scores of each games per participant. That would be epic! @octocat :+1
