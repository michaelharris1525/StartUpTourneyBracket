Again this is a place to take notes in and it would be useful since our finals or something can be used using github. I learned how github can be used with our local github/terminal. 
How code can be used to transfer between peers and fellow coworkers on a project. How we can make mistakes and easily fix them by using the terminal and running certain commands when run
with those errors.
