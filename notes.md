Again this is a place to take notes in and it would be useful since our finals or something can be used using github. I learned how github can be used with our local github/terminal. 
How code can be used to transfer between peers and fellow coworkers on a project. How we can make mistakes and easily fix them by using the terminal and running certain commands when run
with those errors.

I learned a bit about classes and div and how to properly set up selectors and options for my players and score board. HTML is much difficult but easier to use at the same time for me. But its refreshing to use a lot of sources on the web to understand better how to create the brackets.
