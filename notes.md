Again this is a place to take notes in and it would be useful since our finals or something can be used using github. I learned how github can be used with our local github/terminal. 
How code can be used to transfer between peers and fellow coworkers on a project. How we can make mistakes and easily fix them by using the terminal and running certain commands when run
with those errors.

(REQUIRED STARTUP HTML)
I modified the play.html creating tables of (8 player) players, their scores, and organized it in a way that reveals if they are in the semi's or finals or not. It isn't completed yet but it is a start. Also got the link on my about page. I changed the login to include a password. I changed the idea of a betting system to a websocket of a live chat while the tournament is going. I also changed how the scoring system will work that'll list the losers from the beginning to the end. SO if you got 2nd at the tournament you'll be listed last. 

I'm just learning a bit of the HTML, I learned a bit about classes and div and how to properly set up selectors and options for my players and score board. HTML is much difficult but easier to use at the same time for me. But its refreshing to use a lot of sources on the web to understand better how to create the brackets. 

(STARTUP CSS)
4 new css files for "play, scores, styles, and about".

Modified HTML file for play in order for it to contain the players. Used flex to center some of my content around. Add an image to the background of the main and about page. I may modify the page as time goes by, because I'm still unsatisfied with it. Used footers, main, nav, and edited everything i could onto the page. Will most definitely be fixing more and more of it throughout the semester. Added an actual table to both play and the scores page, and added more bars for the players.
